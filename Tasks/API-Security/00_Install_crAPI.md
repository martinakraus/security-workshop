## Preperation

### Docker and docker-compose
You'll need to have Docker and docker-compose installed and running on your host system. 
Also, the version of docker-compose should be 1.27.0 or above. (It usually comes when you install Docker)

Check your docker-compose version using:

`docker-compose version`

### Using prebuilt images

You can use prebuilt images generated by our CI workflow.

To use the latest stable version.

Linux Machine
```
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/crAPI/main/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml

docker-compose pull

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d
```
Windows Machine
```
curl.exe -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/crAPI/main/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml

docker-compose pull

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d
```

## Open Application

1. Visit http://localhost:8888 and sign up.
   Note: All emails are sent to mailhog service by default and can be checked on http://localhost:8025
   You can change the smtp configuration if required however all emails with domain example.com will still go to mailhog.
2. For executing the attacks you can use the [Burp Suite Community Edition](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload) or the postman_collections
